# Accelerating Inference via Multiple Decoding Heads

## Introduction

This project explores techniques to accelerate inference in machine learning models by utilizing multiple decoding heads. We focus on the Medusa technique and our novel token-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods to enhance the efficiency and speed of model inference.

## Medusa Technique

The Medusa technique involves using multiple decoding heads in a language model to generate multiple tokens at a time. This parallel processing approach reduces the overall inference time. Key benefits include:

- **Increased Throughput**: By processing multiple tokens at once, the model can handle larger inputs more efficiently.
- **Reduced Latency**: Parallel decoding reduces the time required to generate outputs, making the model faster.

## Token-Based RL Methods

Our token-based reinforcement learning methods further optimize inference by combining current research in utilizing RL to teach models at a token-level in this inference acceleration environment. More code on this method to come soon.
